            Note: The previous system started everyone at Rank 1, and required - in most cases - considerable time for players to reach a rank that properly reflected their performance. The new system - by way of placement matches - considerably shortens the time required to reach an appropriate rank
        The requirements to access Competitive Mode have changed: If you do not own a Competitive Matchmaking Pass, you must now be at least Casual level 3 in addition to being a Premium user and having a valid phone number associated with your account. 

    Casual Improvements
        Casual Mode now uses the Glicko skill rating system behind the scenes to better create balanced matches and group players by skill level
        The maps listed in the Casual matchmaking screen are now sorted alphabetically
        Added ctf_sawmill, ctf_well, cp_5gorge, ctf_2fort_invasion, and ctf_foundry to Casual Mode
        Updated the match-end map voting to only vote on maps for the current game mode (if you are playing Payload, you will only vote on Payload maps) 

    Queue While Playing
        You can now queue for a match while already in a Casual or Boot Camp match
        While queued and in-game, queue status will be shown in the top right 

    Multi-Queue
        You can now queue for multiple match types at the same time
        Players can queue for all match types in parallel, but accepting a Competitive or Mann Up match will remove the player from other queues
        Players who are in a party and not the party leader are now able to freely browse any of the matchmaking menus 


Gameplay Changes

    Flamethrowers
        Flamethrowers were able to do full damage regardless of the spread of their flames, rewarding maximizing flame spread over focusing on a target. We've made changes geared toward preserving the current damage range of flamethrowers, but requiring better aim to do so.
            Flame damage per second now ramps up based on density of flame encountered, up to 200%
            Initial flame damage per second reduced by 50%, resulting in the max damage being unchanged

    The Dragon's Fury
        We are happy with the design of this weapon, and the playstyle it brings, but it should require tighter hit tolerances in order to reach the higher-end of the damage range
        The size/radius of the fireball has been reduced by 25%
        Bonus damage against a burning target now requires the fireball's center to make contact with the target's hitbox

    The Gas Passer
        We found a couple of issues with the Mann vs. Machine upgrade "Explode on Ignite" that resulted in it doing far more damage than intended. We've increased base damage to help offset some of the reduction in output these fixes bring about.
        Changes to the "Explode On Ignite" upgrade in Mann vs. Machine
            Damage from the upgrade no longer counts toward the refilling the item's charge meter
            Fixed an issue where explosive damage could be reapplied for each target in the gas cloud
            Fixed the triggering bot not taking explosion damage
            Increased explosion damage to 350 (from 250)

    The Axtinguisher
        The slow deploy time -- which is there to help "pay" for the burst-damage this weapon is capable of -- hasn't been very well received, and we agree that it feels awkward. The design goal of this pass is to embrace the concept of a finishing-move weapon -- which requires planning, timing, and introduces opportunity for "combo" gameplay.
        New design:
            Attacks mini-crit and then extinguish burning targets
                Receives a damage bonus based on the remaining duration of after-burn
            Added: "Sketchek's Bequest: Killing blows on burning players grant a speed boost"
            Base damage reduced by 33%
            Holster speed 35% slower
            No random critical hits

    The Thermal Thruster
        We erred on the side of conservative with the initial design -- as this item introduces a lot of mobility to a class that's typically lacked it -- but having watched players for a while, we think it is safe to make it easier for Pyros to switch back to their weapon
            Holster time reduced to 0.8 seconds (from 1.1)

    The Sydney Sleeper
        Jarate is a powerful effect, and this weapon makes it too easy for one Sniper to substantially increase the damage potential of their team. And, unlike the Jarate jar, the infinite-range of the rifle means the Sniper can be far away from danger. These changes are designed to preserve the "Jarate Rifle" identity, but tone it down, add more reward for the Sniper's skill by allowing higher first-shot damage output, and offer a way for players who want to focus on providing area-of-effect Jarate to recharge their Jarate jar more quickly.
            Fully-charged body shots and headshots no longer splash Jarate on players around the target
            Reduced length of on-hit Jarate to 2 to 5 seconds (from 2 to 8 seconds)
            Added: "Nature's Call: Scoped headshots always mini-crit and reduce the remaining cooldown of Jarate by 1 second"

    The Short Circuit
        The current design of zapping projectiles is interesting, but we're not happy with how much it can be done. While it would be easy to simply increase the metal cost (which we've done before), it would quickly push this weapon into the rarely, if ever, used category. Instead, we've changed the fundamental behavior of the weapon, such that it requires a bit more anticipation and positioning from the Engineer, has more skill depth, and increases the team support potential of this weapon.
            Alt-fire attack changed to launch a medium-range, projectile-destroying energy ball. Requires 65 metal.

    Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol
        We underestimated how much health high-skill players would be able to recover during combat.
            Reduced maximum (close-range) per-hit heal amount to 3 (from 7)

    The Panic Attack
        The recent redesign left this weapon feeling a little weak close-in, so we've increased the damage potential at point-blank and close range.
            Reduced worst-case shot pattern spread by 40%
            Reduced damage penalty to -20% (from -30%)

    The Atomizer
        This is basically a bug fix. Players could perform a double-jump and then quickly switch to this item and eke out a third jump. The goal of the previous change was to require players to commit to this item in order to gain the extra jump.
            The weapon must now be fully deployed before a triple jump can be performed

    Fixed being able to collect organs with the Vita-Saw during a truce
    Fixed not being Marked-for-Death when doing a melee attack while under the effects of Crit-A-Cola
    Lag compensation system will now reliably restore pose parameters responsible for animation layering
        This makes server-side hitboxes for lag compensated players better match client-side rendered models
    Fixed stickybombs sometimes blocking explosive damage from other stickybombs
    Fixed The Back Scatter not mini-crit'ing when the Scout was in the air and behind their target
    Fixed the resistance-piercing property on The Enforcer not working against some items or effects (Wrangler shields, Battalion's BackUp, Fists of Steel, Spy invisibility passive resistance, The Dead Ringer, Brass Beast and Natascha)
    Fixed The Sandman and The Wrap Assassin projectiles colliding with invisible objects in team spawn rooms
    Fixed player movement speed sometimes being faster than intended while under the effect of a movement stun (i.e. Natascha, The Sandman's ranged attack, Bonk! Atomic Punch)

    Steam controller improvements
        When using Steam controller configuration to configure non-Steam Controller devices (e.g. Xbox controllers), the proper button icons are now displayed in the UI
        Improved controller icon placement in some UI screens, including for players using less-common aspect ratio displays
        Where text rather than an icon is used to indicate a controller binding, the text strings are now correct for non-Steam controller devices, and slightly more verbose in some cases to avoid confusion with regular keyboard bindings (e.g. "Press [B button]" vs. "Press [B]")
        Fixed miscellaneous corner-case bugs where the wrong action set could be selected, and some edge cases with handling of multiple simultaneous actions during an action-set change
        Added new action bindings for the most popular voice-line commands. The default controller template now binds "Call Medic!" to the directional pad. The following voice lines are also available, but are not bound by default: "Go! Go! Go!", "Move up!", "Spy!", "Ubercharge ready!", "Help!"
    Community request - Added tf_playrounds/tf_listrounds debug commands to jump between mini-rounds on multi-stage maps

Matchmaking

    Redesigned the matchmaking screens to be lightweight overlays that can be summoned and dismissed from anywhere within the game
    Moved the Casual and Competitive badge panels to the main menu
    Casual
        Levels now go beyond 150. All players now have a Tier in addition to their Level. All players start at Tier 1. When your Level goes past 150 your Level resets to 1, your Tier goes up by 1, and your Casual badge will change its appearance to reflect your new status.
        Players who had reached level 150 will have any experience beyond 45500 (the amount required to hit 150) put into an overflow pool. While playing Casual matches, any XP you earn will be matched and deducted from your overflow pool until it runs out.
        The "Vote for the next map!" dialog can now be minimized to view the top scoring players

Contracts

    The Contracts Drawer has been replaced with the ConTracker, a state-of-the-art PDA

    Party members who are on the same server and same team can now help earn progress on each other's Contracts 

Gameplay Changes

    Multi-class
        Panic Attack
            This is one of our least-used weapons. The main culprit seems to be the queued/delayed-fire aspect, which fights against the basic concept of the secondary slot on classes that can use this weapon (Soldier, Heavy, Engineer, Pyro); players generally expect a secondary that is immediately ready to fire - for the rare case where their main weapon isn't available (e.g. out of ammo), or isn't the optimal choice (e.g. airborne, too close, etc.). Removing the queued/delayed-fire concept basically invalidates the original design, so we've started over.
            Goal: Make the weapon immediately usable, remove the large burst potential (generally hard to balance), and give the weapon a unique design space to occupy
            New design:
                50% faster switch speed
                50% more pellets
                30% less damage
                Fires a wide, fixed shot pattern (regardless of server settings)
                Shot pattern grows with successive shots (e.g. while holding down the attack button), but resets after you stop firing or reload
        Reserve Shooter
            Pyros are too easily able to take advantage of this weapon's primary feature via airblast (i.e. no-penalty, on-demand launching of their target), and so their damage-potential can greatly exceed that of the other classes that also use this weapon. Rather than take a heavier-handed approach to solve this, we've instead decided to remove airblast as a source for mini-crits.
                Attacks on targets knocked into the air by Pyro airblast no longer mini-crit
                Added: Attacks on targets flying via the Thermal Thruster mini-crit
    Spy
        Ambassador
            Players that are head-shot from across the map are expecting to see a Sniper in their death-cam, but they sometimes see (more often that we'd like) a Spy with a revolver
            Goal: Reduce the effective combat range to something more reasonable and expected with the Spy
            Changes:
                Headshot damage is now subjected to distance falloff effects
                Headshots beyond 1200 world units do normal (non-crit) damage
        Dead Ringer
            Feign death is an interesting effect, but a good Spy can use it extremely frequently making it frustrating to play against and reducing the risk of using it nearly constantly
            Goal: Rather than make it less interesting, let's make it more predictable to fight against by removing methods by which Spies can reduce its cool-down. This should create more of a rhythm to fighting against a Spy using this and introduce a little more risk to player using it.
            Changes:
                Ammo kits and dispensers no longer refill the Spy's cloak meter
        Your Eternal Reward
            This is the least-used Spy knife (technically, the reskin is, but anyway...). While silent-kill and rapid-disguise-on-kill are good, the downside on this knife is extreme.
            Changes:
                Removed: "Cannot disguise" penalty
                Added: Non-kill disguises require (and consume) a full cloak meter
                    Backstab-based disguises are still free
                Increased cloak drain rate by 33%
    Scout
        Sandman
            The feedback on this weapon has been fairly consistent for a while: Players really hate losing the ability to fight back. Compounding this, the ball has to travel really far in order to disarm players. Being hit by a long-range ball (more often than not) ends up feeling random, rather than skilled.
            Changes:
                Long-range ball impacts no longer remove the victim's ability to fire their weapon (but the victim is still slowed)
                    We've updated achievements that were looking for disarmed players
                Max range balls now do 50% increased damage (from a base of 15)
                The flight time required to trigger the "max" effect has been reduced by 20%
                Ball regeneration time reduced to 10 seconds (from 15)
        Bonk! Atomic Punch
            This weapon was designed to allow Scouts to pierce hotly-contested areas. While it does this quite well, it doesn't require enough skill, or carry much of a down-side.
            Changes:
                Apply a slow effect to the player after phasing wears off, based on the amount of damage they absorbed
                    From -25% at low damage, to -50% at 200+ damage
                    Lasts 5 seconds
        Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol
            This weapon is one of the lower owner-equipped items in the game. Looking at the current design, it seems that not taking falling damage ranks pretty low on the value scale for a Scout, and a flat +20% damage taken penalty is basically the kiss-of-death for a low-health class.
            Goal: Make the weapon less of a liability and focus it as a "get health quick" tool with decent burst, at the expense of total damage
            New design:
                +15% firing speed
                Up to +7 hp per hit (from +5)
                -25% clip size (9 shots)
        Crit-A-Cola
            The last change to this item added Marked-For-Death when the effect ended. This was okay because it forced Scouts to get out after a little while, but it didn't add any risk in-the-moment.
            Goal: Add more decision/thought on when/where to activate and how to manage the risk/reward of the effect
            Changes:
                Added: Each attack while active adds Marked-For-Death debuff for 5 seconds (does not stack)
                Removed: Marked-For-Death when effect expires
                Removed: +25% move speed bonus
                Removed: +10% damage taken penalty
        The Atomizer
            Triple-jump as a passive effect is just too strong. It makes combat against the Scout unpredictable because opponents don't see the bat, and therefore have a hard time anticipating the Scout's capabilities until late in an encounter. It also makes the Scout very strong against explosive classes - due to a combination of extreme mobility and high close-range damage.
            Goal: Require the Scout to deploy the bat to take advantage of the extra jump - which is also is a signal to other players that they can perform an extra jump - and reduce the bat's negatives to compensate
            Changes:
                Triple-jump is now only possible while the bat is deployed
                Removed: Self-inflicted damage when triple-jumping
                Removed: Attack speed penalty
                Added: Melee attacks done while airborne mini-crit
                Added: 50% deploy time penalty (to prevent quick-switch bypass)
                Reduced damage penalty vs players to -15% (from -20%)
        Flying Guillotine
            This weapon is capable of high burst-damage under what sometimes seems like random conditions - such as mini-crits at long-range, and full-crits when the target is slowed or stunned by anything (e.g. Ghost "Boo!" effect, Natascha, etc.)
            Goal: Remove the feeling of randomness, and reward accuracy
            Changes:
                Removed: Crit vs stunned players
                Removed: Mini-crits at long range
                Added: Long range hits reduce recharge (by 1.5 seconds)
                    Distance considered "long range" reduced by half of the previous value when determining mini-crits
    Soldier
        B.A.S.E Jumper
            Players often complain that the B.A.S.E. Jumper is frustrating to fight against because the target is simply too hard to hit. This is mostly due to the combination of being able to deploy/retract at will, and the amount of steering control they have - which makes them too unpredictable.
            Changes:
                Reduced amount of air control while deployed by 50%
                Removed the ability to re-deploy the parachute once retracted (until the player lands on the ground again)
        Mantreads
            The second least-used item in the game. The aerial stomp mini-game is difficult, and The Gunboats are superior in most scenarios.
            Changes:
                +75% push-force reduction now includes airblast
                Added: +200% air control when blast jumping
        Cow Mangler 5000
            Removed: Cannot be Crit boosted
                Granted/earned Crits (e.g. Kritzkrieg) will be converted to Mini-Crits instead
        Righteous Bison
            Note: This weapon has been reverted to its previous design
            Deals 20 damage per tick (down from 45)
                Note: This is necessary because the projectile is no longer limited on the number of times it can hit targets
            Projectiles are no longer limited on the number of times they can hit the same target(s)
            Projectile velocity increased to 1200 (from 840)
    Sniper
        Darwin's Danger Shield
            Snipers using this item had an advantage against Snipers who weren't. As a result, players felt like they were required to equip this item in order to be competitive.
            Goal: Remove the increased survivability against enemy Snipers (which invalidates the existing design).
            New design:
                Counter ranged burn attacks (e.g. flares), and strengthen melee fights vs Pyros
                    Afterburn immunity
                    +50% fire resist
        Razorback
            Goal: Reduce the effectiveness of "pocket'd" Snipers in stalemates/standoffs (this primarily happens in organized/competitive play)
            Changes:
                Added: -100% overheal penalty
                Added: Shield regenerates after 30 seconds
    Medic
        Vita-Saw
            Ubercharge on death is too valuable of an effect to be passive
            Goal: Change the weapon in a way that requires skill and risk in order to gain this effect
            Changes:
                Added "Organs" collecting concept (... you know, hit someone with a saw, and out pops a vital organ which you then take, and hold). Each hit with the Vita-Saw harvests the victim's organs (shown on the HUD).
                Added: On-death, preserve 15% ubercharge per Organ harvested. This effect caps at 60%.
        Crusader's Crossbow
            Bolt healing is very high and significantly out-heals the Medigun when the target is in combat. This might be okay given the trade-offs (risk-vs-reward of ranged shots hitting and the opportunity cost, no overheal). However, it's also the fastest way to build Ubercharge - under the right conditions (e.g. corner damage farming with the Medic behind cover).
            Changes:
                Ubercharge gain rate reduced in the same way that the Medigun's healing (and therefore, Ubercharge build rate) is - based on the last time the target was in combat
                    Reduced by a third when 1 - 10 seconds outside of combat, and scales up to normal over 10 - 15 seconds
    Heavy
        All Miniguns
            Changes:
                The 1-second damage and accuracy penalty now applies to the first second of spun-up time, whether or not the Heavy is firing. Previously, the 1-second damage penalty would only be removed after 1 second of firing.
                Accuracy and damage penalties now reset when the Heavy spins down, rather than when the Heavy stops firing. This means if you stay spun-up beyond one second, and fire in bursts, damage and accuracy will remain at 100%.
        Gloves of Running Urgently
            Speed (lack-of) is used to balance the Heavy's high health, over-heal and damage output. While we still believe it's OK to have a class of items that increases Heavy's movement speed, players have been able to easily bypass the existing negatives.
            Changes:
                Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-10/sec), and regenerated while holstered
                    Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time
                    Each time the gloves are deployed, the drain rate is accelerated for a brief period of time
                Removed: Marked-For-Death effect while active
                Removed: 25% damage penalty
        Eviction Notice
            Changes:
                Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-5/sec), and regenerated while holstered. Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time.
                Removed: 20% damage vulnerability
        Fist of Steel
            The downside of "increased melee damage" doesn't ever really come into play when it counts (e.g. holding a choke point or objective), and when a Medic is attached, the resulting pool of effective-health is unreasonably large
            Changes:
                Added: 40% overheal reduction while active
                Added: 40% healing rate penalty while active
        Added The Second Banana
            Secondary slot item
            When consumed by the Heavy, restores 200 health
            Acts like a small health kit when dropped by the Heavy and picked up by another player
            Item regenerates after 10 seconds
    Engineer
        Doubled the amount of metal applied (per wrench hit) when upgrading buildings during the "Setup" period.
        Rescue Ranger
            The ability to repair buildings safely from range without using metal is powerful. Combine this with the ability to instantly teleport buildings from far away - which by itself is interesting and useful enough in many circumstances - and you end up with a package that is very strong.
            Changes:
                Ranged repairs now consume metal (at a 4-to-1 health-to-metal ratio, e.g. repairing 60 damage costs 15 metal)

        Claidheamh Mòr
            Note: This weapon has been reverted to its previous design.
            Removed: +25 health on kill
            Added: 0.5 second increase in charge duration
    Pyro
        Added The Dragon's Fury
            Primary slot item
            Uses a shared pressure tank for Primary Fire and Alt-Fire
            Primary Fire: Launches a fast-moving, limited-range projectile that deals 25 damage and briefly ignites enemies
                Deals +300% damage to burning players
                +50% repressurization rate on hit
            Alt-Fire: Airblast
                -50% repressurization rate on Alt-Fire
        Added The Thermal Thruster
            Secondary slot item
            Fires a short-duration blast that launches the Pyro in the direction they are aiming
            Deals 3x falling damage to anyone you land on
            Has a 1.1 second holster duration
            MvM upgrades:
                Able to re-launch while airborne
                Stun enemies when you land (duration based on impact velocity)
                    Note: Landing directly on an enemy grants a bonus to stun duration
                Faster recharge rate
        Added The Gas Passer
            Secondary slot item
            Creates a horrific visible gas cloud that coats enemies
            Flammable material then ignites into 10 seconds of Afterburn if enemies take damage (even Pyros!)
            Mann vs. Machine upgrades:
                Enemies explode when ignited by attacks
                Faster recharge rate

            -20% damage penalty
            Every successful slap is announced in the kill-feed
        Flamethrowers
            Better visual sync, more consistent (no visuals/damage mismatch)
            New particle effects
            Applies to all flamethrower variants
        Airblast
            Hit detection for both players and projectiles is now a consistent cone
                Aiming at a player's feet no longer misses!
            Airblasting players now factors in the momentum of the Pyro and target, giving both more control over the interaction
                The target's existing velocity is no longer cancelled
                Players moving at the Pyro at great speed will be reflected away at great speed
                Players moving towards/away from the Pyro will experience less/more push force
            Airblast now causes target player to have reduced footing and air control for a short period
                No longer a flat stun
            Now factors in the upward angle of the airblast, rather than having a fixed upward force
            Total push force slightly increased
        Afterburn
            Flamethrowers no longer apply maximum-duration afterburn on contact. Afterburn duration is now based on how long the target is in contact with direct flames -- starting at a minimum of 3 seconds, and stacking to a maximum of 10 seconds.
            Per-tick afterburn damage increased to 4 (from 3), for a total of 8 damage per-second (up from 6 per-second)
            Flareguns now apply 7.5 seconds of afterburn (down from 10 seconds), resulting in the same total damage as before
            Afterburn now reduces all direct Medic healing and resist shields by 20%
                Note: This effect was previously applied by direct flames from all flamethrowers (at 25%), but was moved to afterburn, and slightly lowered
